# Countries of the World App

## 📄 Instructions
This is a Technical Test. 

The challenge is to establish a connection with the 'Countries' REST API to retrieve and display country data to users.

We will use https://restcountries.com/ as the main data source.

It must be completed within a three-day timeframe.

Framework used: React.

## 👩‍🔧 Project Requirements:
 
Your project should allow users to:

- View all countries from the API on the homepage.
- Search for a country using an input.
- Filter countries by region.
- Clicking on a country should display detailed information on a separate page.
- The design must be responsive.
- Apply hover style for all interactive elements on the page.
- Unit Tests Validation.

#  🎨 Style

- The UI is design by me and I used `Tailwind Css`. 
- The project is also `fully responsive`, for mobile, tablet and desktop.
